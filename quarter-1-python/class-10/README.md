# 🐍 Python Class 10 – 21 June 2025

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 🧩 How Python Works Internally

1. ✅ **Python is Interpreted + Compiled**
   - Python source code is **compiled to bytecode** first.
   - Then it's **interpreted by Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**.

2. ✅ **Bytecode**
   - Intermediate form of code (not human-readable, not machine language).
   - Example: `.pyc` files in `__pycache__/` folder.

3. ✅ **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**
   - Executes bytecode line by line.
   - Manages memory, handles errors, and more.

### ⚙️ Machine Language & Binary

- Computers only understand **binary (0s and 1s)**  
- High-level Python code eventually becomes **machine language**

### 🔢 Binary Numbers

We learned how to convert decimal numbers to binary:

To convert 60 to binary, you can use the method of repeated division by 2: 

1. Divide 60 by 2, which gives 30 with a remainder of 0.
2. Divide 30 by 2, which gives 15 with a remainder of 0.
3. Divide 15 by 2, which gives 7 with a remainder of 1.
4. Divide 7 by 2, which gives 3 with a remainder of 1.
5. Divide 3 by 2, which gives 1 with a remainder of 1.
6. Divide 1 by 2, which gives 0 with a remainder of 1.
7. Stop when the quotient is 0.

Reading the remainders in reverse order (from bottom to top) gives you the binary representation: 111100.

### 🔤 ASCII Characters

- Each character (A-Z, 0-9, symbols) has a number (code)  
- Example:
  - `A` = 65
  - `a` = 97
  - `0` = 48

Check with:

```python
print(ord('A'))   # 65
print(chr(65))    # 'A'
```
