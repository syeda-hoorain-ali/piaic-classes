## 📌 Topics Covered  

### 🔹 n8n (Automation Tool)  
We explored **everything about n8n**:  
- **Left-side Panel** → contains the core functionalities and settings for managing your workflows.  
- **Top bar** → contains workflow name, tag, active/inactive toggle, share and save options.  
- **Node Panel** → where we configure each node’s settings  
- **Canvas** → the main workspace to connect and design workflows

### 🧩 Nodes

We explored **n8n Nodes**:
- **App or Action Nodes** → add, remove, and edit data; request and send external data.
- **Trigger Nodes** → start a workflow and supply the initial data.
- **Core Nodes** → provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls.
- **Cluster Nodes** → node groups that work together, primarily for AI workflows.

📚 **Reference**: [n8n Node Types](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/node-types/)

### 🛠️ Project – Real-World Automation  
We built the project: **Automating a (Real-world) Use Case**  
- Learned to connect nodes step by step  
- Practiced workflow execution and debugging  
- Understood how to combine apps and services in n8n
