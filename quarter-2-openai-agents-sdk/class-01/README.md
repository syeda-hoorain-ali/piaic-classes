# 🤖 OpenAI Agents SDK Class 1 – 16 August 2025

---

## 🎯 Topics Covered  

**n8n**   
A open‑source workflow automation and orchestration platform. 

**Workflows**  
A sequence of steps (nodes) that process data or automate tasks. Example: When an email arrives → Extract text → Save to Google Sheets.  

**3 Waves of AI**  
  1. **Predictive AI:** Uses data to predict outcomes.
  2. **Generative AI:** Uses AI to generate text, images, code, music, etc.
  3. **Agentic AI:** AI that not only thinks but also acts on your behalf, planning, deciding, and taking steps to achieve goals.


**5 Stages of AGI**  
  1. **Chatbots:** AI with conversational language. 
  2. **Reasoners:** human-level problem solving. 
  3. **Agents:** systems that can take actions. 
  4. **Innovators:** AI that can aid in invention.
  5. **Organizers:** AI can perform the work of entire organizations.


**Arena Leaderboard**  
A benchmark site to compare and identify the best LLMs in the world.  

**Why OpenAI Agents SDK?**  
  - Provides a framework for building **AI agents** that can use tools, maintain context, and perform tasks beyond just answering text prompts.  

**Prompt Engineering**  
Crafting better instructions to get accurate AI responses.  

**Notebook LM for Mindmap**  
A way to organize concepts visually for better understanding.

## 📘 Vocabulary

- **Prompt** → The instruction or question given to the AI.  
- **Training** → Teaching AI on large datasets to learn patterns.  
- **Response** → Output generated by the AI.  
- **Inference** → The process of the AI applying what it has learned to new input.  
- **Persona** → A specific role or character the AI takes on (e.g., teacher, assistant).  
- **Tools** → Extra capabilities the AI can use (e.g., calculator, browser, database).  
- **Context** → Background info or memory given to AI to make responses more relevant.
