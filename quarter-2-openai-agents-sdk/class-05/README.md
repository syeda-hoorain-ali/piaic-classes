## 🛠️ Tools in OpenAI Agents SDK

We learned about **tools** that agents can use. Tools help agents perform tasks beyond normal text conversations.

### Types of Tools

1. **Hosted Tools** (require paid OpenAI API key 💳)

   * **WebSearchTool** – Search the internet 🌍
   * **FileSearchTool** – Search inside files 📁
   * **ComputerTool** – Control computer operations 💻
   * **LocalShellTool** – Run terminal commands 🖥️
   * **ImageGenerationTool** – Generate AI images 🎨
   * **CodeInterpreterTool** – Run and understand code 🧑‍💻

2. **Function Tools**

   * Simple Python functions that we mark as tools so agents can use them 🔧

3. **Agent as Tool** (we will study later)

   * Give one agent as a tool to another agent 🧠➡️🤖

## 🧱 4 Primitives of OpenAI Agents SDK

Primitives are the **building blocks** of Agents SDK:

1. **Agent** – Have main AI brain and tools 🤖
2. **Handoff** – Pass task from one agent to another 🔄
3. **Guardrails** – Safety rules and policies 🛡️
4. **Session** – Memory of a conversation 💬🗂️

## 🧾 3 Types of OpenAI API

1. **Chat Completion** – Stateless, no memory between messages 🗨️
2. **Responses** – Stateful, remembers conversation 📝
3. **Assistant** – (More advanced, used for long-term memory & tools)

## ⚙️ Setting Environment Variables (PowerShell)

We also learned how to set **environment variables** in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:NAME="hoorain"
```

This is useful for storing your **API keys** safely 🔑
