# hello-world-speckit Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code must be clean, readable, and maintainable. It must adhere to established coding standards, enforced through automated linting and formatting tools. Code reviews are mandatory to ensure quality and knowledge sharing.

### II. Testing Standards
Every feature must be accompanied by comprehensive and automated tests. This includes unit tests for individual components and integration tests for system-wide functionality. A Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach is strongly encouraged. All tests must pass before any code is merged.

### III. User Experience Consistency
The application must provide a consistent and intuitive user experience (UX) across all features and platforms. All UI components and user-facing interactions must adhere to a centrally defined style guide and design system.

### IV. Performance Requirements
The application must be fast, responsive, and efficient. Performance is a key feature. All new features and changes must be evaluated against performance benchmarks. Load testing and profiling are required for critical paths.

## Governance
This Constitution is the authoritative source for all development standards and practices. Any proposed amendments must be documented, reviewed by the team, and formally approved. A migration plan is required for any changes that affect existing systems. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
