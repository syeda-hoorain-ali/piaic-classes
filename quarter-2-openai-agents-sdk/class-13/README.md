## 💲 Personal Finance Tracker

We created the entire **Personal Finance Tracker** using **Gemini CLI** — without writing a single line of code.
Using the Notion step-by-step guide, we generated two runnable versions:

🌐 **Two versions**

* **CLI version**
* **Web (Streamlit) version**

📕 Guide we followed: [Personal Finance Tracker CLI](https://www.notion.so/Personal-Finance-Tracker-CLI-2aada4c664118005907ce48afdfaba56)

## 📝 Spec-Kit Plus

We also took an overview of **Spec-Kit Plus** (by Panaversity), installed it, created a project, and ran the **constitution** command.
