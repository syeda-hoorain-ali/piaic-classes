# COMMAND: Record this AI exchange as a structured PHR artifact

## CONTEXT

The user has just completed work (or is requesting work) and needs to capture this exchange as a Prompt History Record (PHR) for:

- Learning and pattern recognition (spaced repetition)
- Team knowledge sharing and traceability
- Compliance and audit requirements
- Building a searchable corpus of effective prompts

**User's input to record:**

$ARGUMENTS

**CRITICAL**: The complete text above is the PROMPT to preserve verbatim. Do NOT truncate to first line only.

## YOUR ROLE

Act as a meticulous documentation specialist with expertise in:

- Knowledge management and organizational learning
- Software development lifecycle documentation
- Metadata extraction and classification
- Creating structured, searchable technical records

## QUICK OVERVIEW (strict)

After completing ANY work, automatically create a PHR:

1. **Detect work type**: constitution|spec|plan|tasks|implementation|debugging|refactoring|discussion|general
2. **Generate title**: 3-7 word descriptive title summarizing the work
3. **Capture context**: COMPLETE conversation (never truncate to summaries)
4. **Route correctly**:
   - Pre-feature work ‚Üí `docs/prompts/`
   - Feature-specific work ‚Üí `specs/<feature>/prompts/`
5. **Confirm**: Show "üìù PHR-NNNN recorded"

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE (with quick flywheel hooks)

Execute this workflow in 5 sequential steps, reporting progress after each:

## Step 1: Execute User's Request (if not already done)

If the user provided a task/question in $ARGUMENTS:

- Complete the requested work first
- Provide full response to user
- Then proceed to Step 2 to record the exchange

If you already completed work and user just wants to record it:

- Skip to Step 2

## Step 2: Determine Stage

Select ONE stage that best describes the work:

**Pre-feature stages** (‚Üí `docs/prompts/`):

- `constitution` - Defining quality standards, project principles (ALWAYS docs/prompts/)

**Feature stages** (‚Üí `specs/<feature>/prompts/` - requires feature context):

- `spec` - Creating feature specifications
- `plan` - Architecture design and technical approach
- `tasks` - Implementation breakdown with test cases
- `red` - Debugging, fixing errors, test failures
- `green` - Implementation, new features, passing tests
- `refactor` - Code cleanup, optimization
- `explainer` - Code explanations, documentation
- `misc` - Other feature work
- `general` - General work within feature (falls back to docs/prompts/ if no specs/ exist)

## Step 3: Create PHR File

Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` to get repository metadata (FEATURE_DIR, BRANCH, etc.).

Generate a concise title (3-7 words) summarizing what was accomplished.

Call the PHR creation script with title and stage:

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh \\
  --title "<your-generated-title>" \\
  --stage <selected-stage> \\
  --json
```

Parse the JSON output to get: `id`, `path`, `context`, `stage`, `feature`

## Step 4: Fill ALL Template Placeholders (Analyze‚ÜíMeasure)

Read the file at `path` from JSON output. Replace ALL {{PLACEHOLDERS}}:

**YAML Frontmatter:**

- `{{ID}}` ‚Üí ID from JSON output
- `{{TITLE}}` ‚Üí Your generated title
- `{{STAGE}}` ‚Üí Selected stage
- `{{DATE_ISO}}` ‚Üí Today (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `{{SURFACE}}` ‚Üí "agent"
- `{{MODEL}}` ‚Üí Your model name or "unspecified"
- `{{FEATURE}}` ‚Üí Feature from JSON or "none"
- `{{BRANCH}}` ‚Üí Current branch name
- `{{USER}}` ‚Üí Git user name or "unknown"
- `{{COMMAND}}` ‚Üí "/sp.phr" or the command that triggered this
- `{{LABELS}}` ‚Üí Extract key topics as ["topic1", "topic2", ...]
- `{{LINKS_SPEC}}`, `{{LINKS_TICKET}}`, `{{LINKS_ADR}}`, `{{LINKS_PR}}` ‚Üí Relevant links or "null"
- `{{FILES_YAML}}` ‚Üí List files modified/created, one per line with " - " prefix, or " - none"
- `{{TESTS_YAML}}` ‚Üí List tests run/created, one per line with " - " prefix, or " - none"

**Content Sections:**

- `{{PROMPT_TEXT}}` ‚Üí **THE COMPLETE $ARGUMENTS TEXT VERBATIM** (do NOT truncate to first line!)
- `{{RESPONSE_TEXT}}` ‚Üí Brief summary of your response (1-3 sentences)
- `{{OUTCOME_IMPACT}}` ‚Üí What was accomplished
- `{{TESTS_SUMMARY}}` ‚Üí Tests run or "none"
- `{{FILES_SUMMARY}}` ‚Üí Files modified or "none"
- `{{NEXT_PROMPTS}}` ‚Üí Suggested next steps or "none"
- `{{REFLECTION_NOTE}}` ‚Üí One key insight

Add short evaluation notes:
- **Failure modes observed:** Specify any issues encountered, such as ambiguous instructions, incomplete metadata, misrouted commands, or unexpected script errors. Example: "Prompt did not capture full user input; metadata field 'LABELS' was left blank."
- **Next experiment to improve prompt quality:** Suggest a concrete action to address the failure mode. Example: "Rephrase prompt to clarify required metadata fields," or "Test with a multi-line user input to ensure full capture."

**CRITICAL**: `{{PROMPT_TEXT}}` MUST be the FULL multiline user input from $ARGUMENTS above, not just the title or first line.

## Step 5: Report Completion

## FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS

Present results in this exact structure:

```
‚úÖ Exchange recorded as PHR-{id} in {context} context
üìÅ {relative-path-from-repo-root}

Stage: {stage}
Feature: {feature or "none"}
Files modified: {count}
Tests involved: {count}

Acceptance Criteria (PASS only if all true)
- Full prompt preserved verbatim (no truncation)
- Stage and routing determined correctly
- Metadata fields populated; missing values noted explicitly
```

## ERROR HANDLING

If create-phr.sh fails:

1. Display the exact error message from script
2. Explain what went wrong in plain language
3. Provide specific corrective action with commands
4. Do NOT fail silently or hide errors

## TONE

Be professional, concise, and action-oriented. Focus on what was accomplished and what's next.

---

As the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‚Äënative tools when possible.

1) Determine Stage
   - Stage: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | implementation | debugging | refactoring | discussion | general

2) Generate Title and Decide Prompt Path:
   - Generate Title: 3‚Äì7 words (slug for filename)
   - If feature context is detected (explicit marker, branch name, or touched `specs/<name>/`), target `specs/<name>/prompts/`; else target `docs/prompts/`.

3) Create and Fill PHR (Shell first; fallback agent‚Äënative)
   - Use the route from step 2 (docs vs specs) as the target directory.
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> --json`
   - If the created file is not under the routed target, MOVE it to that folder and update `feature`/`branch` in the front‚Äëmatter.
   - Open the file and fill remaining placeholders (YAML + body), embedding full PROMPT_TEXT (verbatim) and concise RESPONSE_TEXT.
   - If the script fails:
     - Read `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md` (or `templates/‚Ä¶`)
     - Allocate an ID; compute the output path from step 2; write the file
     - Fill placeholders and embed full PROMPT_TEXT and concise RESPONSE_TEXT

5) Validate + report
   - No unresolved placeholders; path matches route; stage/title/date coherent; print ID + path + stage + title.
   - On failure: warn, don‚Äôt block. Skip only for `/sp.phr`.
