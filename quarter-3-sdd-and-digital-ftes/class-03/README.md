# 🤖 Spec-Driven Development & Digital FTEs – Class 3 (3 Jan 2026)

## 🏭 Agent Factory (Slides 29-39)

### The Big Shift

**BEFORE:** Humans use SaaS tools → knowledge in heads → manual work
**AFTER:** Humans manage AI agents → knowledge in specs → automated work

---

### How It Works

1. Write a spec: "Automate Q3 Financial Audits"
2. Claude Code reads it, analyzes APIs/docs
3. Generates Custom Skill.md OR Custom Agent code
4. Production-ready in minutes

---

### The Engine

**General Agents** (Claude Code) manufacture:
- Custom Skills (SKILL.md)
- Custom Agents (SDK code)

**Why?** Code = universal interface
Loop: Read → Think → Code → Execute

---

### Matrix Analogy
Trinity downloads helicopter flying skills instantly = Agents load Skills (SKILL.md) when needed.

**Bottom line:** Claude Code = automated automation creator. You describe WHAT; it builds HOW.
